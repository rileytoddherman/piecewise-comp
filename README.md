# piecewise-comp

For my dearest, Alex. Justin, don't look because it's not my nicest code

### How to do stuff

I hope you can run this on the command line with just `python3 alex.py`. You'll 
need a `data.csv` formatted like the one included in the repo. the output is 
`output.csv`.




### Enjoy!!
